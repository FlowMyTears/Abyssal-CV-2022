CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findngraph.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "ngraph", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ngraph" with any
  of the following names:

    ngraphConfig.cmake
    ngraph-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ngraph" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ngraph_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "ngraph"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
